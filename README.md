## What is the NUC980

> The NUC980 series with the ARM926EJ-S core can operate at up to 300 MHz . It offers 64-pin, 128-pin and 216-pin LQFP packages stacked with 64 MB and 128 MB DDR-II Memory to reduce PCB size and EMI issues. Rich peripherals include 10 sets of UART , dual Ethernet, 4 sets CAN 2.0B, dual SDIO / eMMC interface, NAND Flash interface, QSPI NAND, 8 Ports USB Host, ISO-7816 interface and High-Speed USB 2.0 host / device controller to allow more flexibility in designs. The NUC980 also integrates the crypto engine which provides hardware acceleration for AES, SHA, ECC, RSA  function.
>
> It supports industrial temperature from - 40 ℃  to 85 ℃  and targets Industrial Control, Industrial IoT Gateway, Network Printer, Meter Concentrator and Smart Home Gateway applications.
